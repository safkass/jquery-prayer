jQuery.Prayer is a jQuery plugin aiming at retrieving prayer times from the famous IslamicFinder website, and make triggers upon which you can pull any actions you want at prayer times.

By default in the first version, it's accompanied by jQuery.colorbox plugin, and it shows a youtube video presenting AZAN.
This is to be more custom in future versions.
